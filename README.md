RAG Document Q&A


In this project, I built a Streamlit web app that allows users to ask questions from uploaded research papers using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It integrates GROQâ€™s LLaMA3 language model, HuggingFace embeddings, and FAISS vector search to extract answers contextually from PDF documents using natural language queries.
